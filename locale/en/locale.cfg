negative_space=Negative space

[mod-description]
negative_space=Adds a negative space entity for marking where empty space must be in blueprints that removes entities after the blueprint is placed. Optionally automatically adds negative space around belts or fluid pipes.

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
negative-space=[entity=negative-space] will mark for deconstruction any entity in its way when placed from a blueprint.\n__CONTROL__give-negative-space__ will put it in your cursor.\nThis can be used to remove belts that would change the layout of a pasted blueprint or remove any other entity that might be in the way.
negative-space-blueprint=When creating a blueprint, [entity=negative-space] can be automatically added around belts and fluid pipes. This also works with copy paste.\nBelts and fluid pipes can be configured separately in settings.\nThe above simulation alternates enabled settings between belts, fluid pipes, and both.
